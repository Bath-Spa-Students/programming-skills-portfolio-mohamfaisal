# Creating Variables

# Casting          # If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.
x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
y = int(3)    # y will be 3            
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0

# Get the type     # You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function
